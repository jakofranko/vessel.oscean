BASICS
  Vessels
    & Vessels are words. There are no accounts, any player can take over the vessel of any other player and act through that vessel. Moving through Paradise is done by typing commands into the input bar. By typing enter or leave, you will move the vessel into another.
  Building a world
    & Anyone can create new places to explore, with the {_create_} action, a vessel can create new locations for all players to visit. The {_note_} action allows a player to describe the vessel.

THE INNER HAVEN
  Introduction
    & The Haven is a series of single-player vessels including a few key locations. It can be accessed any time, by warping to 1.
  The Private Room, 19
    & The room is located at 19, and is a place created in order for vessel to leave vessels in for later use.
  The Lobby, 18
    & The lobby displays a longer chat length than most locations.
  Train Station, 22
    & The train station is a tunneling vessel. It allows to traverse vast distances of vessel-space quickly.
  The Telescope, 6
    & The Telescope is a vessel with which a vessel can stare at distant paradoxes.

ADVANCED
  Talking
    & Vessels can communicate with each-other with the {_say_} action.
  Programs
    & A vessel can be made to automate vessel actions. Using the {_program_} action followed by a normal vessel action will enable the vessel to be used and trigger that vessel action.
  Spells
    & Spells are program vessels that can be casted from anywhere in Paradise. A program needs to be programmed, locked, and have the {_something spell_} format to qualify. Once a spell has been crafted, it can be used with the {_cast_} action, from anywhere, by all players.
  Tunnels
    & Tunnels are vessels accessible through any vessel note, not only visible vessels.
  Nullspace
    & Nullspace is empty vessel-space, either beyond the furthest vessel id, or in incomplete vessel-space. Expect unexpected behaviors when in nullspace.
  Paradoxes
    & A Paradox is a vessel that exist inside itself. When a whole world exists within, it is also called a stem.
