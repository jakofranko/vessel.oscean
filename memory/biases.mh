BIASES
  Actorâ€“observer bias
    & {*Tendency*} to overemphasize the influence of their personality and underemphasize the influence of their situation.
  Attentional bias
    & {*Tendency*} to neglect relevant data when making judgments of a correlation or association.

    & {*Tendency*} to test hypotheses exclusively through direct testing, in contrast to tests of possible alternative hypotheses.
  Regressive bias
    & {*Tendency*} to remember high values and high likelihoods/probabilities/frequencies as lower than they actually were and low ones as higher than they actually were. Based on the evidence, memories are not extreme enough.
  Egocentric bias
    & {*Tendency*} to claim more responsibility for themselves for the results of a joint action than an outside observer would. Recalling the past in a self-serving manner. Like remembering one's exam grades as being better than they were.
  Impact bias
    & {*Tendency*} to overestimate the length or the intensity of the impact of future feeling states.
  Information bias
    & {*Tendency*} to seek information even when it cannot affect action.
  Modesty bias
    & {*Tendency*} to blame failures on oneself while attributing successes to situational factors; opposite of self-serving bias.
  Mood-congruent bias
    & {*Tendency*} to recall information congruent with one's current mood.
  Omission bias
    & {*Tendency*} to judge harmful actions as worse, or less moral, than equally harmful omissions.
  Self-serving bias

  Status quo bias
    & {*Tendency*} to like things to stay relatively the same.
  Superiority bias
    & {*Tendency*} to overestimating one's desirable qualities, and underestimating undesirable qualities, relative to other people. Also known as the Lake Wobegon effect.

  Stereotypical bias
    & {*Tendency*} to distort memories towards stereotypes. "Black-sounding" names being misremembered as names of criminals.
  Zero-risk bias
    & Preference for reducing a small risk to zero over a greater reduction in a larger risk.
  Authority bias
    & {*Tendency*} to attribute greater accuracy to the opinion of an authority figure and be more influenced by that opinion.

  Hindsight bias
    & {*Tendency*} to see past events as predictable, based on knowledge of later events. Also known as the "I-knew-it-all-along" effect.
  Optimism bias
    & {*Tendency*} to be over-optimistic about the outcome of planned actions.
  Outcome bias
    & {*Tendency*} to judge a decision by its eventual outcome instead of based on the quality of the decision at the time it was made.
  Positive bias
    & {*Tendency*} to test hypotheses with positive rather than negative examples, thus risking to miss obvious disconfirming tests.
  Positive outcome bias
    & {*Tendency*} to overestimate the probability of good things happening to them.

  Lake wobegon effect
    & {*Tendency*} to report flattering beliefs about oneself and believe that one is above average.
  List-length effect
    & A smaller percentage of items are remembered in a longer list, but as the length of the list increases, the absolute number of items remembered increases as well.

  Modality effect
    & That memory recall is higher for the last items of a list when the list items were received via speech than when they were received through writing.
  Overconfidence effect
    & {*Tendency*} of being more certain than is justified, given your priors and the evidence available.
  Part-list cueing effect
    & That being shown some items from a list and later retrieving one item causes it to become harder to retrieve the other items.

  Spotlight effect
    & {*Tendency*} to overestimate the amount that other people notice your appearance or behavior.
  Subadditivity effect
    & {*Tendency*} to judge probability of the whole to be less than the probabilities of the parts.
  Suffix effect
    & Diminishment of the recency effect because a sound item is appended to the list that the subject is not required to recall.
  Telescoping effect

  Underconfidence effect
    & State of being more uncertain than is justified, given your priors and the evidence you are aware of.
  Verbatim effect

  Mind projection fallacy
    & {*Assumption*} that the way you see the world reflects the way the world really is.
  Typical mind fallacy
    & {*Assumption*} that other people are more like you than they actually are.
  Fallacy of gray
    & {*Assumption*} that because nothing is certain, everything is equally uncertain. It does not take into account that some things are more certain than others.
    & {*The Sophisticate*}: "The world isn't black and white. No one does pure good or pure bad. Therefore, no one is better than anyone else." {*The Zetet*}: "Knowing only gray, you conclude that all grays are the same shade. You mock the simplicity of the two-color view, yet you replace it with a one-color view."
  Planning fallacy
    & Underestimating task-completion times.
  Sunk cost fallacy
    & Letting past investments interfere with decision-making in the present.
  Giant cheesecake fallacy

  Narrative fallacy
    & A vulnerability to over-interpretation and our predilection for compact stories over raw truths.
  Scales of justice fallacy
    & Error of using a simple polarized scheme for deciding a complex issue/ each piece of evidence about the question is individually categorized as supporting exactly one of the two opposing positions.
  Top 1% fallacy
    & Related to not taking into account the idea that a small sample size is not always reflective of a whole population and that sample populations with certain characteristics, e.g. made up of repeat job seekers, are not reflective of the whole population.
  Fallacy of relative privation
    & If something is worse than the problem currently being discussed, then the problem currently being discussed isn't that important at all. In other words: nothing matters if it's not literally the worst thing happening

HEURISTICS
  Absurdity
    & {*Mental shortcut*} where highly untypical situations are classified as absurd or impossible.
