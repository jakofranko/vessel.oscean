REALISM
  & Ontological realism holds that physical objects exit independantly of our own minds, while epistemological realism is the view that statements are true, or false, independantly of wether we believe them to be true, or false.
  & Aesthetic realism holds beauty to be a real property of works of art, there to be discovered by the discerning viewer.

NO.44
  & In a little while you will be alone in shoreless space, to wander its limitless solitudes without friend or comrade forever - for you will remain a thought, the only existent thought, and by your nature inextinguishable, indestructible.
  > <mini>Mark Twain's {{the mysterious Stranger|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mysterious_Stranger}}</mini>

OBJECTIVE BEINGS
  & Every block of stone has a statue inside it and it is the task of the sculptor to discover it. I saw the angel in the marble and carved until I set him free.
