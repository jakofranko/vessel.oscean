PROTEINS
  Basics
    & The function of proteins is to be used for tissue growth and repair, but when carbohydrates and calories are lacking, proteins can be consumed for fuel.
    & The human body's own proteins are constantly being broken down into {*amino acids*} and used throughout its systems. 
  Amino Acids
    & The human body is mostly made of proteins, and proteins are made of amino acids - permutations of carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen and sometimes sulfur. There are 22 amino acids in total and all but 9 can be synthesized, the {*Essential Amino Acids*}. 
  Essentials
    & To be used for growth and repair, a protein needs to be a {*complete protein*}, or have access the full sequence of required essential amino acids. If an essential amino acid is missing, the unsuable remaining amino acids are broken down into fats or sugars.
  Complete
    & Soy products have within them 100% of a complete protein, or the correct ratio of essential amino acids for the body to use in tissue growth and repair.
  High-Quality
    & Examples of foods with essential amino acid content of at least 70% of a complete protein(see {_Limiting Amino Acids_} in {{REF|#ref}}) are oats, garbanzo beans, sunflower seeds, buckwheat, red/white/black beans, rice and peanuts pumpkin seeds.
    & There are also high-quality proteins in green beans, swiss chard, broccoli, mustard greens, asparagus and potatoes but in lesser quantity.

MEAL PLAN
  Cooking Basics
    & The high-quality protein foods can be made whole by combining with other ingredients, but the basic optimal combinations is {*Beans with grains, nuts or seeds*}.

REF
  Vitamins
    - {*A*}: Dark green vegetables, yellow root vegetables and some yellow fruits.
    - {*B*}: Whole grains, potatoes, nutritional yeast, many fresh vegetables.
    - {*C*}: Dark leafy greens, citrus, potatoes, cauliflowers, sweet potatoes and brocoli.
    - {*Iron*}: Legumes and greens.
    - {*Calcium*}: Grains, greens and soybeans.
    - {*B12*}: cannot be found naturally in the vegetable kingdom, and a lack of it can cause nervous system damage. The body stores extra B12 in the liver. There is a negligible amount of B12 in miso.
  Essential Amino Acids
    - {*Tryptophan*}: Limiting Amino Acids in some grains and beans.
    - {*Lysine*}: Limiting Amino Acids in plant, grains, seeds, nuts and beans.
    - {*Methionine*}: Limiting Amino Acids in plant.
    - {*Threonine*}  
    - {*Isoleucine*} 
    - {*Leucine*} 
    - {*Phenylalanine*} 
    - {*Valine*} 
    - {*Histidine*}
