BASICS
  Water
    & In most dry places, desalinated potable water is free or available for cheap. In most tropical islands, potable water is available but often scarce, and so it is best to {*catch rain water*} which can then be treated with bleach: 1/2 tsp for every 5 gallons.
  Showers
    & Coastal locations like marinas and public beaches often have fresh water showers for local swimmers or marina guests. Usually free, or available for use at a nominal fee.
    & We also carry a {{solar shower}}, a black pouch hung outside and made warm by sunlight. We will often simply {*bathe in salt water, and rinse with fresh water*} from a spray bottle in locations where water is scarce.
  Provisioning
    & While modern grocery stores can be found in larger cities, these can often be far apart. In smaller towns, fresh vegetable and fruit markets are seldom open everyday, most only once a week.
    & For remote places, {*canned, dried or shelf-stable foods are a good alternative to refrigeration*}. Choosing canned foods is something worth experimenting with - buy an assortment, find which suit your tastes. We usually look for unsalted ones, without corn syrup.
    & Our favourite canned vegetables are mushrooms, mixed beans and tomatoes. Our favourite dry foods are nori, oats and cornmeal. Our favourite shelf-stable foods are tetrapak tofu, spicy sauces and various japanese condiments.
  Medical
    & Most city-centers will have a hospital, but in most cases you must be self-sufficient. That includes a well-stocked medical supply and the know-how to fix yourself up. In case of a serious injury, you must have the means to get yourself to the nearest clinic. We use {{DAN Boater|http://danboater.org}}, a {*repatriation insurance*} that covers helicopter/transportation fees.
    & We find that {*medical apps for mobiles, and FM armyfield manuals*}, are helpful when dealing with minor burns, cuts and various aches.
  Books
    & While books are great, they take up a lot of space, are prone to mold, and in warm countries, they ultimately attract insects. To protect them from moisture, we have resorted to {*keeping them in ziplock bags*}.
    & Amongst sailors, and likely other types of nomads, books and movies are a trading currency. Social hubs will often have bookshelves inviting you to take and leave a book. We have found countless gems in those.
    & Most of our books now, are on our {*Kindle Paperwhite*}, which takes little battery and allows us to read at night.
  Internet
    & We often find ourselves away from hotspots, and even cellphone reception. We try, as much as possible, to send periodical location updates to our families. We use a satellite phone operating on the Iridium satellites network to do that.
    & The {*Iridium Go satellite phone*} costs around about 100US$/month and allows us to keep in touch with our friends and families via SMS & emails, from anywhere in the world - even the middle of the ocean.
  Visas
    & Some countries require visas in advance, most do not, this also depends on your nationality. The visas are generally free, unless you require an extension for your stay. Upon entry into a new country, you may need to pay the immigration, customs, health and quarantine officers.
    & Upon leaving, a departure tax and varying amounts based on the size and weight of your vessel might also need to be paid. These fees can sometimes total up to 200US$. We find {{Noonsite|http://noonsite.com}} to be a good resource for country-specific information on fees.
  Money
    & Most places that we have visited do not necessarily have ATMs, but always have a bank nearby that will take a VISA card.
    & Better make sure that your credit card will not be blocked when used in foreign countries, and that it will expire at a location that will allow for you to receive a new one.
  Budget
    & Provisioning can be expensive in certain countries, so stocking strategically with cheaper stores, ahead of time, can help to save money.
    & Canning is essential when traveling on a budget, a pressure cooker and glass jars will save you money and will help reduce waste. Preparing your own stores, also means that you choose what goes in it, therefore reducing your intake of added salts and sugars.
  Essentials
    & Being in good physical shape is important, wether you need to run, jump or lift something heavy without injuring yourself. Knowing how to tie solid knots is paramount, knowing how to tie a good {bowline knot} could save your life.
    & A good stainless-steel {*knife*}, a spindle of {*paracord*}, a phone-size {*ziplock bag*}, a waterproof {*flashlight*} and a good {*drinking bottle*} for fresh water will go a long way.
  Nutrition
    & Following a {{plant-based diet|Nutrition}} while traveling is possible. Planning provisions ahead is important, a lot of the places may not have specialty items. We found nutritional yeast, miso, flax seeds and B12 supplements, especially hard to find.
    & Buying a large supply of shelf-stable tofu is always a good idea; as it is a complete protein that can be used to make sauces and sautees, while providing calcium. Carry iodized salt, or items with iodine like seaweed.
    & Staples like nut milks and oats are found everywhere, varying in price and quality. There will always be fresh vegetables available, but the selection can be poor at times. Carrying cans and and dried version of those foods can help, for example: canned and dried potatoes. Canned spinach may not be appealing, but in a place where there are no leafy greens available, it's better than not having any at all.

OFFICE
  Distractions
    & When at anchor, it can sometimes be difficult to stay focused. The weather is king, it determines whether or not we can work. If the weather is foul, we are on anchor-watch to make sure we don't drag.
    & Waves also makes it hard to do simple tasks like writing, or drawing. Depending on the direction of the wind, we need to move the boat and that too, takes focus and time away from work. Calm and sunny days, are distracting in other ways: when the water is clear and teeming with colourful fish, it is difficult to resist jumping off.
    & It is easier to work on projects when docked, as we need not worry about the weather or the charge of our batteries.
  Internet
    & Since connectivity can be rare, and far apart, the time that we do have online is spent wisely. Uploading backups, responding to requests from users, updating our friends and families with our new location.
    & As cellular data is often expensive around islands, disabling autoplay on videos, and disabling image previews is near obligatory.
  Work
    & Working online without a constant internet connection is feasible, but painful. Still, there are ways in which some of the friction can be removed from the process.
    & Getting local SIM cards, with blocks of data, works well within cellphone reception range. But in the constraints of expensive cellphone data, uploading large files can be made possible by offloading heavy-lifting onto remote servers; having your {*server build and upload your projects*} instead of using your laptop batteries and broadband.
    & There is no solution to uploading videos to youtube, it's a costly and lenghty process. We have made the decision to keep our videos under 5 minutes to help reduce upload time.
  Troubleshooting
    & Tools like {*Offline Wikipedia, digital encyclopedias and dictionaries*} a great assets to have aboard. Recipes can often be devised from dictionary descriptions of foreign fruits and vegetables.
    & In the case of a nomad programmer, having the current {*programming language documentation & various source files*} is an asset. Prior to going offline for a few days, we often rip entire sites, or capture specific pages as webArchives. The same goes if drawing references are needed, projects are planned ahead and references are collected while a good internet connection is available.
  On documentating
    & We use a Session 4 GoPro as well as a {{Sony A6000|Camera}} to film our travels. The GoPro has the advantage of being {*light and waterproof*} - making for a perfect everyday-carry camera. Shooting with the SLR requires more planning as it can only used in fair weather.
    & We film as much, and as often as we can. At the end of each month, we watch our footage and write a summary of that month's events. Monthy capsules are planned ahead, and we gather footage based on what is needed. While one is busy recording the narration, the other writes music, the two tracks are then edited together with the collected footage. We have our respective tasks when it comes time to edit, but both of us take part in the filming.
    & In rough weather, we prioritize our own safety above all, and so we rarely have footage of rough seas.
  Computers and software
    & Salt water is highly corrosive, even an open window can let in salt air and long term, it can damage electronics. The usb ports of our laptops, as well as our usb cables have suffered damage as a result of this. We now store all devices and cables away after use, in large plastic containers. Since we use our phones for navigation, or to listen to music outside, we keep them in protective sleeves.
    & Having backups for your devices is of the utmost importance, extra power adaptors and mini usb cables are a must. Extra computers is also recommended, especially if you are working somewhere where new hardware is impossible to find, or too expensive.
    & If you can work on a machine that costs less money, do it. If something happens to it, it wont be too complicated to replace. Macbooks consume a lot of energy, and battery life is always an issue. Power consumption is something that should be taken into account when choosing a computer for working at sea.
    & We use a {{Chromebook}} to do our writing work, it is also our media station. We work on macbooks, but would like to change this in the future. Using an Ipad for sketching and drawing is a good solution, as is using Ronin which uses less power than photoshop.
    & We have a {{500G portable hardrive}} that is waterproof and shockproof, we store all of the footage we shoot as well as backups of files that had not yet been uploaded online.
